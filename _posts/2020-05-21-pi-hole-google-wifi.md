One of the first projects I wanted to try with my new Raspberry Pi was running [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/). Pi-hole is a software tool that blocks internet ads before they ever download -- not just on a single web browser, but _on your entire network_.

## Pi-hole Basics

Pi-hole operates as a [DNS sinkhole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_sinkhole), essentially filtering every DNS request made by devices on your network. Requests for valid web services are returned, while requests for ads are blocked. Pi-hole filters the DNS requests for ads by comparing each request to a blacklist of known ad servers

But unlike traditional browser-based adblocking plugins, Pi-hole doesn't just _hide_ the ads a web page returns -- it never requests them in the first place! This makes page loads quicker and reduces network traffic, making everything just feel _zippier_.

On top of all that, Pi-hole comes with a nifty admin dashboard that shows you in real time all the requests made on your network, which devices are making the queries, and how many queries have been blocked.

## Installing Pi-hole

It's a simple three-step process to get Pi-hole running on your home network:

1. Install a supported OS
2. Install the Pi-hole software
3. Configure Pi-hole as your DNS server

I'll be using a Raspbery Pi for my Pi-hole server, and running it on a Google WiFi mesh network, which adds a few challenges to the setup.

### 1. Installing an Operating System

Required equipment for my setup is as follows:

- Raspberry Pi Zero W (\$10)
- 16GB Micro SD Card, Class 10 (\$8)
- Micro-USB Power Supply, 5V 2.5A (\$5)
- [Pi Zero Case](https://flirc.tv/more/flirc-raspberry-pi-zero-case) (\$5--\$15)

I did all the setup of my Pi Zero W in "headless" mode, so there was no need for plugging in keyboards or displays. I installed the latest Raspbian Lite image rather than a full distro with the desktop GUI, since I'd only be accessing the Pi-hole via SSH or the web-based admin dashboard.

Read the full details in my [Headless Raspberry Pi Zero W Setup]({% post_url 2020-05-20-raspberry-pi-zero-w-setup %}) article.

### 2. Install Pi-hole

The simplest way to get up and running is to use Pi-hole's one-step automated install. As noted in the Pi-hole documentation, [curling and piping to bash](https://pi-hole.net/2016/07/25/curling-and-piping-to-bash) is controversial, so if you'd like to inspect the script before you run it, you may want to follow the instructions for [alternate installation methods](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/#alternative-install-methods) from the Pi-hole GitHub repo.

Otherwise, copy and paste the following into a terminal session:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
```

This will launch the automated installer. Just follow the prompts and you'll be on your way. It takes a few minutes to install, so be patient, and the installer will occasionally need some input from you.

Pi-hole needs a static IP address to function correctly. You can let the installer use whatever dynamic IP address your router has assigned to it, or you can set a different unique address yourself.

{% include image.html file="pi-hole-static.png" %}

When the installer finishes, you should get a message like the one below.

{% include image.html file="pi-hole-complete.png" %}

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
  <b>Note:</b> Be sure to copy and save your login password before closing this screen!
</div>

### 3. Configure DNS

#### Pi-hole Built-in DHCP Server

```bash
http://pi.hole/

or

192.168.86.XX
```
