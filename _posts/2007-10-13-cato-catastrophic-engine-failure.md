The [Rocket-Mounted Video Camera Project]({% post_url 2007-10-11-rocket-mounted-video %}) came to an abrupt end as the V-2 model rocket _Prima Donna_ suffered a catastrophic failure (CATO) on its first launch attempt. Although tragic, the CATO was captured on video from multiple angles, and represents a classic case of a rare Estes engine failure.

An examination of the video and debris suggests that the extreme cold (-15Â°C) caused the propellant grain to separate from the interior wall of the rocket motor case.

When the motor was ignited, the rising pressure in the combustion chamber forced the unburned portion of the propellant violently up and out of the case, destroying the engine mount and tailcone. The propellant grain was then ejected out the top of the airframe, cracking the base of the nosecone, and continued to sail roughly twenty meters into the air. All of this happened in an instant.
